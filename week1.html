COURSE OVERVIEW

Practice Computational Thinking (CT) = a problem solving process computer scientists use
Decomposition: Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts
Pattern Recognition: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data
Abstraction: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns
Algorithm Design: Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems
Learn to represent knowledge w/ data structures
Utilize iteration and recursion
Organize & modularize systems using object classes and methods
Learn about the various classes and complexities of algorithms
ALGORITHMS                                       
= a process or a set of rules 2 be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations
1) sequence of steps
2) flow of control
3) a means of knowing when 2 stop 
A conceptual idea vs a program = a instantiation of an algorithm
Instantiation = a concrete instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template
ABSTRACTION
Establishes a level of complexity on which the person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level
Occurs anytime u see a simplified version of a more complex system (e.g. subway map or heart w/ arrow)
