ALGORITHMS                                       
= a process or a set of rules 2 be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations
1) sequence of steps
2) flow of control
3) a means of knowing when 2 stop 
A conceptual idea vs a program = a instantiation of an algorithm
Instantiation = a concrete instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template
ABSTRACTION
Establishes a level of complexity on which the person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level
Occurs anytime u see a simplified version of a more complex system (e.g. subway map or heart w/ arrow)

FUNCTIONS OF A COMPUTER
1) calculate
2) remember

LIMITATIONS OF C.
Turing Halting Problem = we cannot know with certainty that another program will work 100% of the time
Impossible to solve
Encryption = process of converting data into code esp 2 prevent unauth access; capitalizes off unsolvable computer problems

TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE
Declarative = facts
Imperative = recipe; step by step process
E.g. algorithm

STORED PROGRAM COMPUTER
=sequence of instructions stored inside a computer
Built from predefined set of primitive instructions
Arithmetic logic
Simple tests
Moving data
Interpreter = a special program in a computer that walks thru the set of instructions in the program in order(=executing each instruction), doing the computations the programmer desires
Uses tests to change flow of control through sequences
Stops when done
(ant.) Fixed program = designed to compute precisely one computation

BASIC MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
Memory = storage for data or program
CPU = Central Processing Unit
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)= does primitive ops
Control Unit = keeps track of operations I wish to perform in the ALU at each point in time; tells us where we are in a sequence of instructions
Contains program counter = points to the location of the first instruction; when the programmer asks the machine to execute, the program counter reads that first instruction and THEN adds one to the program counter which takes it to the next step in the sequence


BASIC PRIMITIVES
Most C. come w/ simple arithmetic and logic operations
Turing showed u can compute ANYTHING that is computable w/ just 6 primitives
Can abstract methods to create new primitives
E.g. in programming the sqrt algorithm we “act as if” the sqrt was a primitive that came with the C
Turing Complete= Anything computable in 1 programming language is computable in other programming languages
Though some things are easier or more convenient to compute in 1 language vs the others
E.g. Matlab easier 2 manipulate matrices
C is easier for web programming

The computer does not have to simply execute the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line. The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.This means that if an instruction says to branch or go to a different instruction. This is called branching in programs, & is a key way that flow is controlled depending on certain conditions.

CREATING RECIPES
Program = a specific set of statements we can store in the machine so the interpreter can run those operations with the primitives to do work for us
Recall a programming language provides a set of primitive operations; the primitives themselves are inherent to the machine
Expressions = complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language
Any legal expression has a value associated with it
Expressions and computations have values and meanings in a programming language

ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE
Primitive constructs
English: words
Programming languages: strings, numbers, simple operators
Syntax = Determines whether a string has meaning; parsing of a sentence to knows if a subject is legal or not
“Makes sense logically e.g. “dog eats food” vs. “dog turtle cat”
Semantics = the meaning associated w/ that syntactically correct string of symbols w/ no semantic errors
Static semantics = tells us which syntactically valid strings actually have a meaning
E.g. 3* “hi” doesn’t make sense bc I cannot multiply a number and a string
In programming languages, only one meaning for semantically and syntactically correct, BUT it might not express the meaning you intended


PYTHON PROGRAMS
Program = sequence of definitions and commands
Definitions are evaluated
Commands are executed by Python interpreter in a shell
Shell = a window into which one can type expressions. The expressions are passed to the interpreter which follows the set of instructions to figure out what the semantics are (=the meaning of the expression); a window the interpreter is “listening to”
Commands (=statements) instruct interpreter to do something
Can b typed directly into shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated

OBJECTS
objects=the fundamental primitives we use to represent data; programs manipulate data objects to get parts of those objects or to so something with them
Every object has a type associated with it that tells us what kind of thing it is and tells the program whether it can act on it or not
Can be
1) scalars = cannot be subdivided
2) non-scalar = have internal structure that can be accessed; can be subdivided

SCALAR OBJECTS
In Python, very few of them
Int = represents integers e.g 5
float= represents real numbers; things w/ #s after decimal point e.g 3.27
bool= reps Boolean values, T or F
NoneType - special and has one value, None

**Can use type() to see the type of an object**

CASTING =TYPE CONVERSION
Important, esp for numbers

Shell = a window into which one can type expressions. The expressions are passed to the Python interpreter which follows the set of instructions to figure out what the semantics are (=the meaning of the expression); a window the interpreter is “listening to”
Execute directly in it OR we can store it in a file that gets read into the shell when we're ready to use it
Commands (=statements) instructing interpreter to do something
we can execute directly within Python (i.e. Execute within shell)
Can b typed directly into shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated

OBJECTS
objects=the fundamental primitives we use to represent data; programs manipulate data objects to get parts of those objects or to do something with them
Every object has a type associated with it that tells us what kind of thing it is and tells the program whether it can act on it or not
Valuable bc if a program is expecting a number and I give it a string, it's not going to try and do something with it. 
Can be
1) scalars = cannot be subdivided
2) non-scalar = have internal structure that can be accessed; can be subdivided

Int = represents integers e.g 5

bool= reps Boolean values, T or F
NoneType - special and has one value, None

**Can use type() to see the type of an object**

CASTING =TYPE CONVERSION
Important, esp for numbers
E.g. integer 5 converted to a floating number = 5.0
E.g float 3.4 to int = 3
Note the number is simply truncated
Print returns that NoneType scalar object = it prints out nothing
in the middle of a computation and we want to print something out to the shell, we can use a print command to do that

EXPRESSIONS
Expressions = formed by combining objects and operators 
Syntax for simple expression:
Object + operator + another object
Any expression that is syntactically valid has a value, which has a type
Compile = convert (a program) into a machine-code or lower-level form in which the program can be executed.

COMPARISON OPERATORS ON -ints & float
Operator list (i and j are any variable names)
i // j   → int division “integer division” = quotient w/o remainder
i / j    → division “standard division” = results in float
i % j  → just the remainder
i ** j   → i raised to power of j
i == j → equality test, true if i is equal to j
i != j  → inequality test, T if i not equal to j

If either a float, the result is a float
PEMDAS for operator precedence order

EXAMPLES
- - 4 = (-1)*(-1)*(4)
10/3 = 3.3333 (to 4 decimal place)

BINDING VARIABLES AND VALUES	
a value to a variable name		
pi_approx = 22/7
			
value stored in computer memory				
an assignment binds name to value
				
retrieve value associated with name or variable by invoking the name, by typing pi 

In Python, we do an assignment using an equal sign.
There is an assignment of a name to a value.
E.g. Tthe equal sign gives us an expression
called an assignment that says bind to
or associated with the name pi the value 3.14159. Once we have that, we can use pi wherever we would like.
I've bound pi to a number.

It's simply following the sequence
of instructions we gave it.
And that means that if we want to do something different,
we would need to recompute area.
An assignment statement says, find the value
on the right hand side of the expression.
Take the name on the left and assign that name to that value.


Incrementing = +1 (shorthand “+=”)
And that is simply short for saying radius += 1 is radius equals radius incremented by 1.

ABSTRACTING EXPRESSIONS	

LOGIC OPERATORS ON bools
a and b are any variable names
not a → True is a is False; False if a is T
a and b → True if both are true
a or b → True if either or both are T

BRANCHING PROGRAMS
Conditional = the simplest branching statement; a test that evaluated T or F
Indentation provides a visual structure that reflects the semantic structure of the program
Run in constant time = max time of program run depends on programs length; in most cases code executed once
EX:

X = int (input (‘Enter and integer: ))  
if x%2 == 0:    ← Test
     print (‘’)
    print (‘Even’)
else:
    print (‘’)
    print (‘Odd’)
print (‘Done with conditional’)

COMPOUND BOOLEANS
Elif =”else if” if the test above is F, see if this is T. If T, execute elif block, but if F, continue w/ program
A way of giving a sequence of tests in order
EX:
if x < y and x < z:   
     print (‘x is least’)
   
elif y < z:
    print (‘y is least’)

else: 
    print (‘z is least’)

    CONTROL FLOW - BRANCHING
    <condition> has a value True or False
    Evaluate expressions in that block if <condition> is T
    
    
    The computer does not have to simply execute the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line. The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.This means that if an instruction says to branch or go to a different instruction. This is called branching in programs, & is a key way that flow is controlled depending on certain conditions.
    
    PRACTICE PROBLEMS
    True or False = TRUE
    False or False = FALSE
    not False = TRUE
    not(4 > 3 and 100 > 6) = TRUE
    3 + 5.0 = 8.0
    5/2 = a float, 2.5
    5/2 == 5/2.0 = bool, T
    5/2.0 = float, 2.5
    round(2.6)= int, 3
    int(2.6) = int, 2(this just truncates #)
    2.0 + 5.0 = 7.0
    5*2 == 5.0 * 2.0 = bool, T
    >>> a = 3
    >>> a == 5.0
    >>> a
    A is an int equal to 3
    As you can see the last input that was given to the shell was a. The last assigned value of a also happens to be 3. That is the reason the shell outputs the value 3. However just preceding the line where the value of a is given to the shell. There should be a line where the shell returns a boolean value False because a conditional statement is being used where we compare the given the integer to a float value.
