COURSE OVERVIEW

Practice Computational Thinking (CT) = a problem solving process computer scientists use
Decomposition: Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts
Pattern Recognition: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data
Abstraction: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns
Algorithm Design: Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems
Learn to represent knowledge w/ data structures
Utilize iteration and recursion
Organize & modularize systems using object classes and methods
Learn about the various classes and complexities of algorithms

ALGORITHMS                                       
= a process or a set of rules 2 be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations
1) sequence of steps
2) flow of control
3) a means of knowing when 2 stop 
A conceptual idea vs a program = a instantiation of an algorithm
Instantiation = a concrete instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template
ABSTRACTION
Establishes a level of complexity on which the person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level
Occurs anytime u see a simplified version of a more complex system (e.g. subway map or heart w/ arrow)

FUNCTIONS OF A COMPUTER
1) calculate
2) remember

LIMITATIONS OF C.
Turing Halting Problem = we cannot know with certainty that another program will work 100% of the time
Impossible to solve
Encryption = process of converting data into code esp 2 prevent unauth access; capitalizes off unsolvable computer problems

TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE
Declarative = facts
Imperative = recipe; step by step process
E.g. algorithm

STORED PROGRAM COMPUTER
=sequence of instructions stored inside a computer
Built from predefined set of primitive instructions
Arithmetic logic
Simple tests
Moving data
Interpreter = a special program in a computer that walks thru the set of instructions in the program in order(=executing each instruction), doing the computations the programmer desires
Uses tests to change flow of control through sequences
Stops when done
(ant.) Fixed program = designed to compute precisely one computation

BASIC MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
Memory = storage for data or program
CPU = Central Processing Unit
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)= does primitive ops
Control Unit = keeps track of operations I wish to perform in the ALU at each point in time; tells us where we are in a sequence of instructions
Contains program counter = points to the location of the first instruction; when the programmer asks the machine to execute, the program counter reads that first instruction and THEN adds one to the program counter which takes it to the next step in the sequence


BASIC PRIMITIVES
Most C. come w/ simple arithmetic and logic operations
Turing showed u can compute ANYTHING that is computable w/ just 6 primitives
Can abstract methods to create new primitives
E.g. in programming the sqrt algorithm we “act as if” the sqrt was a primitive that came with the C
Turing Complete= Anything computable in 1 programming language is computable in other programming languages
Though some things are easier or more convenient to compute in 1 language vs the others
E.g. Matlab easier 2 manipulate matrices
C is easier for web programming

The computer does not have to simply execute the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line. The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.This means that if an instruction says to branch or go to a different instruction. This is called branching in programs, & is a key way that flow is controlled depending on certain conditions.

CREATING RECIPES
Program = a specific set of statements we can store in the machine so the interpreter can run those operations with the primitives to do work for us
Recall a programming language provides a set of primitive operations; the primitives themselves are inherent to the machine
Expressions = complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language
Any legal expression has a value associated with it
Expressions and computations have values and meanings in a programming language

ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE
Primitive constructs
English: words
Programming languages: strings, numbers, simple operators
Syntax = Determines whether a string has meaning; parsing of a sentence to knows if a subject is legal or not
“Makes sense logically e.g. “dog eats food” vs. “dog turtle cat”
Semantics = the meaning associated w/ that syntactically correct string of symbols w/ no semantic errors
Static semantics = tells us which syntactically valid strings actually have a meaning
E.g. 3* “hi” doesn’t make sense bc I cannot multiply a number and a string
In programming languages, only one meaning for semantically and syntactically correct, BUT it might not express the meaning you intended


PYTHON PROGRAMS
Program = sequence of definitions and commands
Definitions are evaluated
Commands are executed by Python interpreter in a shell
Shell = a window into which one can type expressions. The expressions are passed to the interpreter which follows the set of instructions to figure out what the semantics are (=the meaning of the expression); a window the interpreter is “listening to”
Commands (=statements) instruct interpreter to do something
Can b typed directly into shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated

OBJECTS
objects=the fundamental primitives we use to represent data; programs manipulate data objects to get parts of those objects or to so something with them
Every object has a type associated with it that tells us what kind of thing it is and tells the program whether it can act on it or not
Can be
1) scalars = cannot be subdivided
2) non-scalar = have internal structure that can be accessed; can be subdivided

SCALAR OBJECTS
In Python, very few of them
Int = represents integers e.g 5
float= represents real numbers; things w/ #s after decimal point e.g 3.27
bool= reps Boolean values, T or F
NoneType - special and has one value, None

**Can use type() to see the type of an object**

CASTING =TYPE CONVERSION
Important, esp for numbers
