Bash = a Unix shell and command language written. First released in 1989,[10] it has been distributed widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS (formerly OS X).
 A version is also available for Windows 10. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands 
 from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for 
 condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a 
 POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

 The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces[13] and on the common term "born again".[14][15]
 
 A security hole in Bash dating from version 1.03 (August 1989),[16] dubbed Shellshock, was discovered in early September 2014 and quickly led to a range of attacks across the Internet.[17][18][19] Patches to fix the bugs were made available soon after the bugs were identified. 

Dependancies= Dependency is a broad software engineering term used to refer when a piece of software relies on another one. 
Coupling (computer programming) In software engineering, coupling or dependency is the degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other modules. 

Initialize = the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable. The manner in which initialization is performed depends on programming language, 
  as well as type, storage class, etc., of an object to be initialized.
Recursion = adj. recursive

JSON = JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is a file that can be manipulated by code very easily. I can't find the 'download resources' button but it will likely just be a file that gives the names and links of the relevant resources.

Scripting language=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language

Shell script = a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a <strong>command-line interpreter</strong>. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. 
  Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup, 
  logging, etc. is called a <strong>wrapper</strong>.

Transpose Function = takes a collection of columns and returns a collection of rows. The first row consists of the first element from each column. Successive rows are constructed similarly.
